# Extended Docker image to run a PHP:fpm

This Dockerfile will compile into a Docker image that is based on a [php:fpm](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/).
Additionally,

* it has the PHP-MySQL extension installed
* sSMTP is installed to provide mail support

There is [an article about this Docker image](https://binfalse.de/2016/11/25/mail-support-for-docker-s-php-fpm/) in [my blog](https://binfalse.de).
